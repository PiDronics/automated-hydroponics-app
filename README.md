# PiDronics - Automated Hydroponics system app

## Overview
Hydroponics is a compact and efficient alternative to soil agriculture. One of the major challenges faced by hydroponics farmers is measuring important values from their system and making the necessary adjustments. This is time consuming and sometimes can be costly. This application simply grabs sensor data from a hydroponics loop and displays it in a clean, intuitive interface. Some of the readings taken are as follows:
- Water temperature
- Nutrient concentration
- Dissolved Oxygen
- Humidity of the air
- pH of water

## Goals
- To make hydroponics easier for farmers
- To help farmers better understand the needs of their crops
- To encourage more people to get involved in hydroponics

## Coming soon
- Acceptable ranges of values
- Real time graphs
- Allowing a single user to have multiple groups of sensors
