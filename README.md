# PiDronics - Automated Hydroponics system app

## Overview
Hydroponics is a compact and efficient alternative to soil agriculture. One of the major challenges faced by hydroponics farmers is measuring important values from their system and making the necessary adjustments. This is time consuming and sometimes can be costly. This application simply grabs sensor data from a hydroponics loop and displays it in a clean, intuitive interface. Some of the readings taken are as follows:
- Water temperature
- Nutrient concentration
- Dissolved Oxygen
- Humidity of the air
- pH of water

## Goals
- To make hydroponics easier for farmers
- To help farmers better understand the needs of their crops
- To encourage more people to get involved in hydroponics

## Serve

Running `npm run start` to serve to localhost:3000. Webpack is listening for changes in your IDE so you don't need to restart everytime.

## Build

Running `npm run build` to produce an optimized, deployable React Application

## Testing

Running `npm run test` will run all of the testing suites in the `/src` folder. Note that react testing files are typically names `component_name.test.js`

## Coming soon
- Acceptable ranges of values
- Real time graphs
- Allowing a single user to have multiple groups of sensors
